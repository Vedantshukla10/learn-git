SED - Stream EDitor 

s-substitute

Matches replaced = cat -n sample.txt(line by line with numbering)

                   cat -n sample.txt | sed 's/this/vedant/' (will replace this with vedant
                                                              but will do only for 1 this in one line
                                                            if 2nd this comes it will remain this)

                   cat -n sample.txt | sed 's/this/vedant/g' (will replace all this with vedant)
                  
                   cat -n sample.txt | sed 's/^/vedant/g' (will put vedant at beg of each line)

                   cat -n sample.txt | sed 's/$/vedant/g' (will put vedant at end of each line)

                   cat -n sample.txt | sed '3! s/this/vedant' (except third line)

cat -n sample.txt | sed G (will put space in end of each line)

cat -n sample.txt | sed -n 2,3p (will print from line 2 to line 3)

cat -n sample.txt | sed '2,5d' (delete lines two to five)

cat -n sample.txt | sed '$d' (delete last line)

cat -n sample.txt | sed -e 'G' -e '3d' (mltiple cmds in single line)

cat -n sample.txt | sed 'G;G' (Give two liner spaces)

cat -n sample.txt | sed '/yyou/ s/this/vedant/' (if there is yyou in line replace this 
                                                 with vedant)

cat -n sample.txt | sed '1~3d' (every third line deleted 1,4,7,10,,,)

cat -n sample.txt | sed '0~3d' (lines that are multiple of 3)

cat -n sample.txt | sed '0~3p' (every third line will be reprinted)

cat -n sample.txt | sed 's/this/\U&/g' (Capitalizes all this)

cat -n sample.txt | sed 's/this/vedant/ig' (replaces all this with vedant ignoring case)

sed -i 's/this/vedant/' sample.txt (to make chages in the actual file )

AWK

awk '{print;}' sampleawk.txt (print all content )

awk '{print $1;}' sampleawk.txt (prints first column)

awk '{print $NF;}' sampleawk.txt (to print the last column)

awk '{print $(NF-1);}' sampleawk.txt (to print second last column)

awk -F ":" '{print $1;}' sampleawk.txt  (: se ple ka sab)

awk -F ":" '{print $2;}' sampleawk.txt (: k baad ka sab)

cat sampleawk.txt | awk '$4=/M/' (in table where gender is male'

cat sampleawk.txt | awk '$3==$2' (where col 3 and 2 are same)

cat sampleawk.txt | awk '{print $4}' | awk '! ($0 in array) (array[$0]; print)' sampleawk.txt

head and tail 
good for reading logfiles

head bootstrap.log (first 10 lines)
tail bootstrap.org (last 10 lines)
head -n3 bootstrao.log (first 3 lines)
head -f bootstrap.log(to follow if there is some change in the file its reflected in the terminal)
head bootstrap.log jenkins.log (we can see 10 lines of even multiple files)
quest - from line a to line b ?
